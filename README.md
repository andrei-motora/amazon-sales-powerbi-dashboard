# Amazon Sales Performance Dashboard (Power BI)

## Project Overview
This project presents an Amazon-style sales and profitability dashboard built in Microsoft Power BI.
The goal was to transform incomplete and imperfect e-commerce data into management-ready insights.

The dashboard focuses on revenue, profitability, marketplace performance, and product behavior.

## Business Questions Addressed
- Which marketplaces generate the highest revenue and profit?
- Which products drive volume but underperform on margins?
- How do discounts and costs impact profitability?
- How does performance evolve over time across marketplaces?

## Data Challenges
The dataset reflected realistic business issues:
- No predefined profit or COGS columns
- Discount and tax values initially missing or set to zero
- Uniform quantities across categories
- Missing product-level attributes

These issues required data enrichment and logical assumptions to avoid misleading insights.

## Tools & Techniques
- Microsoft Power BI
- Power Query (data cleaning and enrichment)
- DAX measures (Revenue, Profit, Margin, AOV)
- Data modeling
- Dashboard UX and navigation design
